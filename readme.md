# yaEMDpy

**yaEMDpy** refers to *yet another Empirical Mode Decomposition toolbox for python*. As it names suggest is an EMD approach.

## Code Example

To decompose the signal the variable $y=v(t)$ into three levels:

> \>> imfs, res = extractimf(t, y, nIter=3)

To draw the Hilbert spectrogram of the signal

> \>> spectrogram(t, imfs)

## Motivation

It is a clean pure python implementation, therefore it is very easy to implement changes a variations of the algorithm.

## Installation

Not decided yet.

## API Reference

Ye to be prepared.

## Tests

Run the example:

> python example_in_R.py
